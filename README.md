# Digital Clock
Digital clock implemented with Block Diagrams on Quartus.

# Good Practices
- Put your module on the modules directory and create, on the root directory, a _test and _waveform.
- Do not modify the .gitignore (it removes databases, output_files, simulation and so on from the repository)

# Modules
- Comparators: 1 and 4 bit comparator
- Arithmetic: adders, subtractors and counters
- Decoders: bcd to 7 segment decoder

# Roadmap
- Fix hour module and test on the DE2-115
